Settings

Commands
--------

////
Detailled description of all commands
////

`:ApplyHeadingStyle [style]`::
  `[style]` may be any of `setext`, `atx`, `syncatx` +
  Apply a certain heading style on all section headings in the current buffer.
  If no style is given, use the default style defined in g:asciidoc_title_style.


Text objects
------------

// FIXME: All of these mappings would shadow existing useful text objects.
//        What are good alternatives? Prepending them with <localleader> is _not_ useful
- block
  * ib (in block)
  * ab (a block)
  * Ab (a block)
- table
  * it (in table)
  * at (a table)
  * At (a table)
- section
  * is (inner section)
  * as (a section)
  * As (a section)
- list

Completion
----------

This plugin provides https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#compl-omni[Omni
completion] for entering cross references. At the moment this only completes
section headings in the current file, but will probably be extended to support named
anchors and cross references to other files.

Syntax highlighting
-------------------

////
More detailed explanation of the syntax highlighting
////


A good syntax highlighting fulfills two purposes:

- Make the source easier to read by highlighting certain structuring elements
- Give hints about valid syntax elements

Compiler
--------

Folding
-------


Known Shortcomings
------------------

- Imperfect Sytax highlighting
  Due to the bad decision to use the same characters for Setext underlines
  as well as block delimiters and vims restricted syntax highlighting it is
  not always possible to differentiate between Setext section headers and the
  end delimiters of block elements. Therefore some blocks will be incorrectly
  highlighted.
