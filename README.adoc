[WARNING]

*ATTENTION!* This is work in progress. This plugin is not stable yet. It is
already very usable, but be aware that some of the functionality described here
may not be implemented or doesn't work reliably.

////
Some nice ideas for IDE support of Asciidoc can be found here:
https://discuss.asciidoctor.org/Ideas-for-an-Asciidoctor-Editor-IDE-td3542.html

Especially:
- Change rag of biblio reference (what is in the [[[]]]) and have it
  updated everywhere in the document
- Display all internal xrefs that have no target (why doesn't asciidoctor
  complain about that?)
- Bibliography management (what could that be? Integrate bibtex?)
- Add include / image via file selection dialog
- Command / Map to select possible attributes for a macro (like image
  'align')
  The same would be nice for other elements (tables, etc.)
- A table editor (but how should that work?)
////

// TODO: Command / Map for caption texobject. Then we could 'cic' to edit
// the caption. Maybe use the same to add it (select the place where it
// would appear)?

// TODO: Toggle between inline and block macro (for images, etc.)

Introduction
------------

////
Why this plugin?
What does it provide?
 - syntax highlighting
   handy functions

Short overview of
 - mappings
 - commands
////

This plugin tries to achieve the following goals:

  - Support all valid asciidoc / asciidoctor syntax elements
  - Provide a good out-of-the-box experience without any configuration
  - Allow configuration to override or disable defaults
  - Provide asciidoc-specific functionality to ease the creation and
    modification of asciidoc documents

Some of the highlights of this plugin:

 Intelligent cross references::
   This plugin provides a list of possible anchors for inserting cross
   references. This avoids illegal cross reference due to typos or having
   to manually look up the correct anchor name.
 Navigation mappings::
   This plugin provides mappings for easy navigation between the sections
   of the document.
 Text objects::
   This plugin provides text objects for several typical asciidoc elements
   to allow easy selection and modification of such elements, like
   sections, blocks or list items.
 Document structure outline::
   This plugin can display an outline of the the current document to have a
   quick glance over all section titles. This outline view can be used for
   navigating to specific sections, too.
 // Syntax highlighting?
 // Integration with makeprg to fill quickfix list with compilation errors
 // or warnings?
 // Folding?
 // Resemble document structure in this list and let the titles be links to
 // the corresponding sections?



Mappings
--------

// TODO: Categorize / Group in "Navigation", "Editing", etc.?
//       Maybe even more
// TODO: Set links to the relevant sections in the asciidoctor user guide

Settings
--------

////
What option exist, What do they to?
////

Commands
--------

////
Detailled description of all commands
////

`:ApplyHeadingStyle [style]`::
  `[style]` may be any of `setext`, `atx`, `syncatx` +
  Apply a certain heading style on all section headings in the current buffer.
  If no style is given, use the default style defined in g:asciidoc_title_style.


Text Objects
------------

// FIXME: All of these mappings would shadow existing useful text objects.
//        What are good alternatives? Prepending them with <localleader> is _not_ useful
- block
  * ib (in block)
  * ab (a block)
  * Ab (a block)
- table
  * it (in table)
  * at (a table)
  * At (a table)
- section
  * is (inner section)
  * as (a section)
  * As (a section)
- list

Completion
----------

This plugin provides https://vimhelp.org/insert.txt.html#compl-omni[Omni
completion] for entering cross references. At the moment this only completes
section headings in the current file, but will probably be extended to support named
anchors and cross references to other files.

Syntax Highlighting
-------------------

////
More detailed explanation of the syntax highlighting
////

////
FIXME: Syntax highlighting is really extremely slow.
The worst is asciidocLiteralParagraph.
But also asciidocTablePrefix and a few others
////

A good syntax highlighting fulfills two purposes:

- Make the source easier to read by highlighting certain structuring elements
- Give hints about valid syntax elements

Compiler
--------

Folding
-------

Known Shortcomings
------------------

- Imperfect Sytax highlighting
  Due to the bad decision to use the same characters for Setext underlines
  as well as block delimiters and vims restricted syntax highlighting it is
  not always possible to differentiate between Setext section headers and the
  end delimiters of block elements. Therefore some blocks will be incorrectly
  highlighted.
